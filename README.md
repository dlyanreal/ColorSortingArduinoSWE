# ColorSortingArduinoSWE
Project with the Society of Women Engineers for a Color-Sorting Arduino Robotic Arm

As a Technical Officer representing Cougar AI, I served as the programming expert for all 5 groups' projects for the Society of Women Engineers in Spring 2025.

The Color-Sorting Arduino Robotic Arm was the main project, and I collaborated with Mechanical and Electrical Engineers to synthesize software and hardware, learning C++ outside of my classes in order to deliver the successful final product of a functioning, color-differentiating and sorting robotic arm, which earned People's Choice for Best Project.

Color detection was handled by a TCS3200, with the S2 and S3 pins' outputs being used to measure and classify the color of the objects to be sorted.

The project used an Arduino Nano, a breadboard, 3D printed parts for the robotic arm, claw and swivel, chopsticks, male-to-male, female-to-female and female-to-male electrical wiring, and I used the Arduino IDE for the ease of implementation of the written code.

The mechanical engineering was done by Asheeyana Ahmed, and the project itself was very engaging as the process of troubleshooting issues (electrical, programming, mechanical) challenged my previous programming experience by nature of having to consider a wider scope of factors that influenced the final behavior rather than strictly code.
